    "## Name of the App\n",
    "\n",
    "- RepShare\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target User: Who is this app designed for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- RepShare is designed for personal trainers, fitness coaches and gym staff with the primary purpose of allowing easy creation, organiziation and sharing of workout routines with other employees and clients. It may also be useful for experienced athletes looking to build training plans and share them with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2‚Äì3 Main Functions: What are the most important features you plan to implement?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workout Builder Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trainers can put together a workout using a form input style input, with options for warm-ups, strength, cardio, etc. grouped by day or week. Exercises can include custom info such as rep/set, labels, or links. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan Exporting and Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once a plan has been created it can be exported in multiple different human-readable formats (Markdown, PDF, CSV, Excel Sheet) or it can be shared as a hosted website. The primary purpose allows for easy sharing of workout plans with clients or others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Template / Library System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trainers can save already created workouts and use them as templates for future workouts or share them with others so they can change them to their liking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Rationale: Explain how your idea reflects product sense‚Äîe.g., what user problems it solves, key usage scenarios, and why these features are part of your MVP (minimum viable product).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - RepShare is built to take care of the needs of real-world trainers, often many personal trainers use note apps, spreadsheets or PDF templates are often clunky to update and difficult to share with others. RepShare aims to capture functionality in the way trainers actually think by providing workouts grouped by type (warm-ups, stretches, strength training, cardio, etc.) and easy considerations for trainings for weeks in advance.\n",
    "- Personal trainers don't need another calorie counter or fitness tracking app, they need a purpose built app allowing easy sharing of their workouts in a professional and clean looking format. By focusing on a clean output (PDF/Web) and creating a reusable environment for trainers this app aims to replace the inefficent methods many personal trainers use today.\n",
